# MSJS
This tool is designed to help teach programming to students who are in middle school. Using modern web APIs, the tool is able to convert a simplified version of Javascript back to native code that can be instantly run in the browser. In addition, using built-in lesson tools, the software can help guide your students as you instruct them.
